New in the R interface
----------------------

- A new layout generator called DrL.
- Uniform sampling of random connected undirected graphs with a 
  given degree sequence.
- Edge labels are plotted at 1/3 of the edge, this is better if 
  the graph has mutual edges.
- Initial and experimental vertex shape support in 'plot'.
- New function, 'graph.adjlist' creates igraph graphs from
  adjacency lists.
- Conversion to/from graphNEL graphs, from the 'graph' R package.
- Fastgreedy community detection can utilize edge weights now, this 
  was missing from the R interface.
- The 'arrow.width' graphical parameter was added.
- graph.data.frame has a new argument 'vertices'.
- graph.adjacency and get.adjacency support sparse matrices, 
  the 'Matrix' package is required to use this functionality.
- graph.adjacency adds column/row names as 'name' attribute.
- Weighted shortest paths using Dijkstra's or the Belmann-Ford 
  algorithm.
- Shortest path functions return 'Inf' for unreachable vertices.
- New function 'is.mutual' to find mutual edges in a directed graph.
- Added inverse log-weighted similarity measure (a.k.a. Adamic/Adar
  similarity).
- preference.game and asymmetric.preference.game were 
  rewritten, they are O(|V|+|E|) now, instead of O(|V|^2).
- Edge weight support in function 'get.shortest.paths', it uses 
  Dijkstra's algorithm.

Bugs corrected in the R interface
---------------------------------
  
- A bug was corrected in write.pajek.bgraph.
- Several bugs were corrected in graph.adjacency.
- Pajek reader bug corrected, used to segfault if '*Vertices' 
  was missing.
- Directedness is handled correctly when writing GML files.
  (But note that 'correct' conflicts the standard here.)
- Corrected a bug when calculating weighted, directed PageRank on an 
  undirected graph. (Which does not make sense anyway.)
- Several bugs were fixed in the Reingold-Tilford layout to avoid 
  edge crossings.
- A bug was fixed in the GraphML reader, when the value of a graph
  attribute was not specified.
- Fixed a bug in the graph isomorphism routine for small (3-4 vertices)
  graphs.
- Corrected the random sampling implementation (igraph_random_sample),
  now it always generates unique numbers. This affects the 
  Gnm Erdos-Renyi generator, it always generates simple graphs now.
- The basic igraph constructor (igraph_empty_attrs, all functions 
  are expected to call this internally) now checks whether the number
  of vertices is finite.

  now.

  under development but useful
- very basic 3D plotting using OpenGL

Although this release was somewhat tested on Linux, MS Windows, Mac
OSX, Solaris 8 and FreeBSD, no heavy testing was done, so it might
contain bugs, and we kindly ask you to send bug reports to make igraph
better.

igraph mailing lists

I've set up two igraph mailing lists: igraph-help for
general igraph questions and discussion and
igraph-anonunce for announcements. See 
http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/igraph-help and
http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/igraph-announce
for subscription information, archives, etc.

igraph 0.1
=========

Released Jan 30, 2006

After about a year of development this is the first "official" release 
of the igraph library. This release should be considered as beta 
software, but it should be useful in general. Please send your 
questions and comments.
